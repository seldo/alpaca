# Alpaca Blue

It's another Mastodon client. I'm sorry.

Specifically, it is a paired set: `react-native` is an iOS app and `take2` is a web app.

## Why?

* Partly as an excuse to try building a substantial "serverless" app using Remix
* Partly because all the existing Mastodon clients have incredibly terrible notification screens and it was driving me crazy
* I want quote-posts and embedded tweets
* I don't want local or federated timelines

## What does it do?

At the moment very little. You can
* Log in from any instance
* View your timeline
* See your notifications (they are batched like Twitter, this is the primary differentiator so far)
* View threads, and reply with correct threading
* Post (text only so far)
* Like and repost
* View profiles
* Search for things

## What doesn't it do

Well, everything else, but in particular
* No DMs yet (I am considering a totally parallel, actually private DM solution)

## Known bugs

So many. There is a [project tracker](https://github.com/users/seldo/projects/3/views/1) so you can see what is and isn't on my radar.
