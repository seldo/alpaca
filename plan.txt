Alpaca blue cases:

- login
	- user selects instance
	- oauth2 dance delivers credentials
	- credentials saved on client
	- proxy gives you a cookie to remember you
- view timeline
	- client loads saved posts from localstorage
	- client creates long running connection
	- client translates mastodon links into proxy links
		- any username becomes a proxy link to that user
		- any post becomes a proxy link to that post
	- every post is stored in localstorage
- media
	- cache and proxy media?
		- saves instances bandwidth
		- makes the experience faster
		- worth paying for?
		- revenue share based on bandwidth usage
- users
	- client views users with account fetch API
		- every account object is saved in localstorage
- proxy links
	- user:
		- if proxy knows you:
			- bounce to client and fetch as normal
		- if proxy doesn't know you:
			- proxy fetches or registers a new app client
			- fetches user if public
			- displays user
			- if you click follow
				- bounce to client and goto login
	- post:
		- if proxy knows you
			- bounce to client and fetch as normal
		- if proxy doesn't know you
			- fetch and display post in standard UI
			- if you click like/reblog/reply
				- bounce to client and goto login
- mentions
	- client loads saved mentions from local storage
	- then the 40 most recent mentions
	- then backwards from there until it reaches duplicates
	
Implementation notes:
- timeline
	- load saved posts
	- load most recent posts from remote
	- if there are posts before most recent but after saved posts insert a [more] loader
	- add the streaming loader
- loading a thread
	- from universal ID
	- call to the original instance for thread
	- render
	- if logged in
		- call to our instance for internal data
		- hydrate
	

cd /opt/app;
docker-compose exec streaming sh -c "RAILS_ENV=production bin/tootctl media remove --days 0;" 

            <VisibilitySensor onChange={infiniteScroll}>
